### Background
In this notebook, an analysis of King County sales data in the United States for years 2014-2015 will be conducted. The purpose of the analysis is to derive conclusions for business decision making purposes, affecting current homeowners and prospective buyers of this specific area. King county, is one of three Washington state counties that include Seattle, Bellevue and Tacoma area. It covers an area of of approximately 39 towns and cities. U.S Census Bureau stats indicate the county has a population of approximately 2.2 million people as of 2020.

### Business Understanding & Business Problem
Understanding that my business stakeholder can be a real estate agency, who would want to advice both buyers and sellers on this market, it is important to note that in this type of business, both buyers and sellers are interested in price. Therefore, it is important to understand the database first, navigage its features, identify what other categories besides price are availble to try to define and predict what exactly is the best correlation to price.


### The Data

This project uses the King County House Sales dataset, which can be found in  `kc_house_data.csv` in the data folder in this assignment's GitHub repository. The description of the column names can be found in `column_names.md` in the same folder. As with most real world data sets, the column names are not perfectly described, so you'll have to do some research or use your best judgment if you have questions about what the data means.

### Hypotheses

Null hypothesis (H0): There is no relationship between our features and our target variable, price.  

Alternative hypothesis (Ha): There is a relationship between our features and our target variable, price.

I will be using a significance level (alpha) of 0.05 to make our determination, and will make our final recommendations accordingly.
